; Note on comments:
; - Stuff with ****** around it is an area indicator
; - Japanese text is the original script
; - Text in ALL CAPS is the original English translation
; - Most other text is Paul Jensen's original retranslation from 2002
;
; Special code legend:
;
; <number> = render a number. Also sets a suffix flag if the number is 0 or >1.
; Note that in several places the number is fixed, but it saves ~35 bytes to 
; use this tag (and the ones below) rather than include digits in the text
; (as that adds additional Huffman trees).
; However, in some places we spell words out (e.g. "three", "tenth") for 
; better grammar.
; <s> = ‘s’ if the suffix flag is set (see above).
; <internal hint nn> = word wrapping bug helper. The suffix insertion confuses 
; the wrapper, so add this *before* the space before the word where the 
; suffix gets added, with n = the number of characters potentially added to 
; the word - so:
; "You found <number> meseta<s> inside"
; becomes
; "You found <number><internal hint 01> meseta<s> inside"
; and
; "You gained <number> experience point<s>."
; becomes
; "You gained <number> experience<internal hint 02> point<s>."
; This is a bit of a hack because it wraps as if the suffix there is even 
; when it isn’t.
; 
; <article> = use article for enemy/item, lowercase
; <Article> = use article for enemy/item, initial uppercase
; 
; <width nn> = wrap at width n (hex)
; <height nn> = insert waits so text "pages" at height n
;
; <player> = player name
; <monster> = enemy name
; <item> = item name
;
; <line> = line break
; <wait> = wait, end of entry
; <end> = end of entry
; <wait more> = wait, not end of entry
; <delay> = delay a bit
