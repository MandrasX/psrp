Bugs: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed "Defense" value showing up as "Attack" in the Stats Menu

the error was in ps1jert.sms.asm:

  call DrawTextAndNumberBC
  ld hl,Attack
  ld a,(ix+8)
  call DrawTextAndNumberA
  ld hl,Defense
  ld a,(ix+9) ; was ld a,(ix+8)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Re)(De)(Un)localized Text Strings:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Names]

Tylon		-->	Tyron ; a common complaint
LaShiec		-->	Lashiec ; matches the PSIV localization

[Enemies]

Monster Fly 	-->	Sworm ; Too iconic
Shark King 	-->	Fishman ; Too iconic, most people spent years of their life grinding these. 
                	Lorewise, both fishmen and batmen (werebats) are humans genetically modified 
			by Lashiec for aquatic/aerial combat.

Dragon Wise 	-->	Wise Dragon ; don't know why the adjective was placed after the subject on these two.
Dezorian Head 	--> 	Head Dezorian

Robot Police	-->	Robot Cop
Machine Guard	-->	Android Guard ; retains more of the original localization flavor: "Androcop".


[Spells]

Troop		-->	Teleport (originally FLY; Teleport in PS Generation 1 remake translation)
Super heal	-->	Super Heal (overworld version of "heal" was in lower case)
Waller		-->	Wall
Transrate	-->	Translate (spelling error?)
Magic Waller	-->	Protection (originally PROT; note: Wall and Protection are exactly the same)

This is just another pass to wipe out the last bits of Engrish, fix some small errors,
and address some contextual problems.

// corpse --> fate; technically Nero is not yet dead at this point.

; Citizens of Camineet, this boy’s corpse is a reminder for all of you.
  Citizens of Camineet, this boy’s fate is a reminder for all of you.

// Condenses Suelo's dialogue on return visits so no additional button press is required to print all text.
// A player might come back here upwards of 100 times a playthrough; so this one is a major QoL thing.

; Please get some rest. Your brother would be proud of you. But don't overdo it, okay? Come back here anytime.
  Please rest. Your brother would be proud of you, but don’t overdo it, okay?


[4f19]
// Included as a nod to the original localized name.

; A powerful Esper, Lutz lives in Mahal cave, north of here. Take this letter to him.
  A powerful Esper, Noah Lutz, lives in Mahal cave to the north. Take this letter to him.

[00E]
// Included as a nod to the original localized name. Adds something to the idea that Tyron may 
// be a bit of a blowhard, and not quite the warrior his reputation implies.

; Nero asked me to help him find a warrior named Tylon, are you looking for him too?
; The last I heard, he was staying in a town called Shion. Maybe he's still near there.
  Nero asked me to help him find a warrior named Tyron, or ‘Odin’ as he likes to call himself.
  The last I heard he was staying in a town called Shion. Maybe he's still there.


[4c03]
// Reverted (with lower case on "east"); it just feels more succinct/natural.

; If you travel East, you will reach the port town of Shion.
; If you're looking for a port town, Shion is just east of here.
  If you travel east, you will reach the port town of Shion.


[4c0f]
// In Mahal cave, Lutz refers to a "manhole cover" at Camineet spaceport, impling something more like a sewer. 
// Personally, the term "catacomb" caused me undo confusion in my playthrough.

; I hear you can get to the Gothic Forest -- which is West of Parolit -- through an underground passageway.
; Did you know there’s an abandoned catacomb leading west, to the Gothic Woods? Supposedly it’s somewhere nearby, but I can’t find it.
  Did you know there’s an abandoned sewer leading west, to the Gothic Woods? Supposedly it’s somewhere nearby, but I can’t find it.


[4c40]
// Fixed typo; Motvaia --> Motavia


[4caa]
// The original line had more readability. Pluralized laboratory to give a sense Gothic may have 
// been a center of technological research and production rather than just a single facility.

; Rumor has it that the Gothic Laboratory was once used to build spaceships.
; Back in the old days, ships like these were built at the laboratory in Gothic.
; Ever been to Gothic? Back in the old days, ships like these were built in its laboratory.
  Back in the old days, ships like these were built in the laboratories at Gothic.


// Reverted; the original line was a bit more evocative.
[5145]
; Lashiec’s evil influence has corrupted our village, too! Please, you have to stop him!
  The evil hand of Lashiec has extended to this village as well! Please help us!


// Kind of an awkward (Engrish-sounding) line.
[531a]
; Before Lashiec’s powerful grasp, this village was very wealthy.
  Before Lashiec’s oppressive rule, this village was quite wealthy.


// Reverted; the original line was more elegant and evocative. 
// Plus "His (He has?) magical powers to snatch away your very soul!" makes no sense as written.
[5607]
; LaShiec’s more dangerous than most people realize. His magical powers to snatch away your very soul!
  All those who have gone up against Lashiec have had their souls taken by his magic.


// Reverted with tweak: A dramatic pause before party is imprisoned allows this line to retain 
// the "humor" of original line and the seriousness of the 2008-20 line.
[55c5]
; Let me see here... Hm? This is a fake! Don't think you can fool me just because I'm a robot! Let me show you to your cell.
; This is a fake. Where did you get this? Well, you certainly picked the right place to get locked up. Come with me.
  Let me see here... Hm? This is a fake! Don't think you can fool me just because I'm a robot! ...Let me show you to your cell.


// destroy --> defeat; A villain who is contemptuous of the heroes would use a milder term when rhetorically questioning their ability to undo him.
[576a]
; [...] And you have what? Weapons? Magic? Did you really hope to destroy me?
  [...] And you have what? Weapons? Magic? Did you really hope to defeat me?


// life --> era ; "A new life in Algol" (new life for whom, what?)
[5789]
; [...] Lord Lashiec has fallen. Nero’s dying wish was granted. A new life has begun in Algol. The only thing left to do is return to the Governor-General in Paseo!
  [...] Lord Lashiec has fallen. Nero’s dying wish was granted. A new era has begun in Algol. The only thing left to do is return to the Governor-General in Paseo!


// "The creatures subsided" sounds a bit odd.
[47da]
; Gradually, the sky brightened. The creatures subsided. Peace returned.
  Gradually, the sky brightened. The monsters retreated. Peace returned.
